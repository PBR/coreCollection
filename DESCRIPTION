Description: 
  This package can be used to create a Core Collection based on a distance matrix and applying
  the A-NE (accession nearest entry), E-NE (entry nearest entry) or E-E (entry entry) method.
  Optionally a list of preselected accessions to be included into the core can be set.
  For each accession in the computed core, if available nearby accessions are retrievable 
  that can be used as an alternative.
